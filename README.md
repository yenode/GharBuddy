# GharBuddy Context-Aware Smart Home for Indian Households:

GharBuddy is a proactive, context-aware smart home assistant designed for Indian households. It understands daily routines like morning pooja, pressure cooker whistles, load-shedding windows, and caregiver anomalies, acting autonomously to preheat water, dim lights, schedule inverter charging, and alert family members.

## Overview of GharBuddy:

GharBuddy bridges smart home devices with state-of-the-art Generative AI reasoning. Instead of relying solely on hard-coded schedules or manually triggered scenes, it uses an LSTM machine learning routine combined with LLM orchestrations (AWS Bedrock Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Google Gemini 3.5 Flash) to infer intent and take preemptive action. The front-end React interface is built with premium aesthetics, offering a live 2D digital twin of the home alongside real-time telemetry, AI decision consoles, and neighborhood micro-grid statistics.
